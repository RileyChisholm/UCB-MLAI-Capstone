#### Research Question
How has urbanization influenced local climate patterns, including temperature and air quality, in major US cities over the past 50 years?

#### Results from the Analysis
Overall Key Takeaways and Trends
1. Population as a Predictor:
    * Temperature: Urban population alone is not a strong predictor of average temperature changes. Other factors beyond urban population are likely driving changes in average temperature.
    * Air Quality: Population alone is not a strong predictor of air quality. Other variables such as industrial activity, traffic emissions, and regulatory measures play crucial roles.
2. Improvement Over Time:
    * Temperature: The SARIMA models indicated potential long-term warming trends in some cities, which could be related to broader climatic changes rather than just urban population growth.
    * Air Quality: The general improvement in air quality over the past five decades highlights the effectiveness of environmental policies and technological advancements.
3. Seasonal Variability:
    * Temperature: Strong seasonal components were observed in temperature data, with natural seasonal variations being a dominant factor in temperature changes.
    * Air Quality: AQI demonstrated strong seasonal variability, influenced by weather patterns, industrial activity, and other temporal factors.
4. Urbanization Impact:
    * Temperature: Urbanization showed weak correlations with temperature changes, indicating that other environmental factors need to be considered.
    * Air Quality: While urbanization tends to correlate with lower AQI (improved air quality), the relationship is weak. Larger cities may have better air quality management practices that help maintain lower AQI levels.
Conclusion
The combined analysis underscores the importance of considering multiple factors, including seasonal variations, broader climatic trends, and urban management practices, in analyzing temperature and air quality changes in urban areas. While urban population growth has some influence, it is not the sole driver, and other environmental and regulatory factors play significant roles in shaping local climate patterns.
